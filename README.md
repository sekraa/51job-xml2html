# 51job-xml2html
XSLT Script to convert XML CVs from 51job.com to simple easy to read HTML files

Description
-----------
This script converts XML resume files generated by 51job.com for EDI into simple human readable HTML files that can be opend with any Web browser or MS Word, for instance.

Prequisites
-----------
You need to download the free and Open Source XMLStartlet into the ./lib directory to be able to run the Windows Batch script. http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmlstar/files/xmlstarlet/

Usage
-----
Drag & drop a single 51job.com resume file onto "convert-51job-xml.bat". The script will convert the file to a human readable HTML file with the same name plus ".html" as extension.


Technical Information
---------------------
The converstion is done with a XSL transformation (.\lib\51job-convert-v1.xsl). The actual transformation is done with "XMLStarlet", a free command line XML toolkit which can be used to transform, 
query, validate, and edit XML documents.

Due to limitations of the way how MS Windows works with batch files, it's recommended to place the script in a folder such as "D:/51job-resume-viewer" and processes XML from folders with short names and without special characters.
